<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started my coding journey in 2022 on the MIMO app. After realizing my aptitude for
     coding and acknowledging my own proclivity for comprehending complex mechanical
     operations I decided to commit to obtaining programming certifications. My first
     immersive curriculum was on freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design in 2024 where I
     completed 300 hours of coding/programming training and received my Responsive Web
     Design certification. After receiving my freecodecamp.org certification I continued
     my coding/programming education at Udemy.com. I am currently enrolled in The Complete
     2024 Web Development Bootcamp: By Dr. Angela Yu, Developer and Lead Instructor and
     will continue to The Complete Full-Stack JavaScript Course: By Joseph Delgadillo.
</p>
<p>My purpose for learning full-stack coding/programming is to transition into the future
    of tech, create a better financial lifestyle and develop my own application, preferably
    in the gaming industry. My ultimate goal is to integrate my application in the meta-universe
    of gaming and translate the game into real time applications; social status, financial
    status, real-estate, music, sex and fashion. My vision is for the digital application I
    create to become a staple in everyday life usage. Users will be able to customize avatars
    to be viable representatives for social interactivity and develop occupational skills to
    earn status and income in the metaverse. If the final rendition of my ambition vision is
    to be compared to anything, I would compare it to Gregarious Games in Ready Player One.
